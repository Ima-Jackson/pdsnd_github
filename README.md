Udacity Bikeshare Data Analysis Project


Introduction


The Python Script Project is for the Udacity Programming for Data Science with Python Nanodegree Program, and it is basically for the exploration of data related to the US Bike Sharing System for three major cities in the United States - Chicago, New York City and Washington. It imports data from csv files and answers interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. The Python Script also takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.


Datasets

* Start Time 
* End Time 
* Trip Duration
* Start Station 
* End Station 
* User Type


The Chicago and New York City files also have the following  two columns:

* Gender
* Birth Year


Statistics Computed

You will learn about bike share use in Chicago, New York City, and Washington by computing a variety of descriptive statistics. In this project, you'll write code to provide the following information

* The most common month
* The most common day of week
* The most common hour of day
* The most common start station
* The most common end station
* The most common trip from start to end
* The total travel time
* The average travel time
* The counts of each user type
* The counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
* The earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)

Requirements
  
* Python 3.6 and above
* Pandas, numpy, and time
